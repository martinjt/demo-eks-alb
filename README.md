Minimal demo: AWS EKS with ALB
==============================

- Uses the default backend configuration (local file named `terraform.tfstate` -- **this has been .gitignore-d!**).
- AWS authentication requires additional configuration, such as selecting a CLI profile. For more, see https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#authentication-and-configuration.
